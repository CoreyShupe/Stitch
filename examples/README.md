# Examples

Examples work rather differently in this project; to display the functionality of the program we'll have a few different
javascript projects with various layouts. <br />

To run each example you'll need to use the scripts in (the script's directory)[../scripts]. The `example.sh` script
followed by the app you want to use will execute that example. <br />

For example, `./scripts/example.sh basicapp` executed from the root directory will execute the BasicApp example.
It is important to remember; you **must** execute the script from the root directory of the project.

## BasicApp

BasicApp represents some random script that you might whip up to solve a quick problem.
